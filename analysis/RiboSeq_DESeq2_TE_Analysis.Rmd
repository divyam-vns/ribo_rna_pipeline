A documented R Markdown file that:

loads step07_deseq2/differential_TE_results.tsv and TE_log2_per_sample.tsv,

produces MA & volcano plots, TE scatter (RNA vs Ribo fc), top candidate heatmap,

loads step03_riboQC/psite_table.tsv to produce metagene around start codons.
(You can use the notebook we assembled earlier — paste its code into an .Rmd and knit to HTML/PDF.)
